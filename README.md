# TESTed: universal judge for testing code in education

Organisation of the repository:

- `docker`: Docker files for creating a Docker image of the judge
- `exercise`: contains a test exercise (TODO: move this to somewhere else)
- `judge`: Python project containing the code of the actual judge that will be run by Dodona
- `run` (file): Needed for the Docker image, starts the judge
- `thesis`: LaTeX files for the actual text. See the readme in that folder for compilation instructions.
