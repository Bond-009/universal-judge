# Description for function program exercises
# Example for exercise https://dodona.ugent.be/nl/courses/392/activities/1013186526/
# For each tab we will use on dodona, we need a 'tab' field
- tab: "Feedback"
  # Each tab consists of a list of evaluation contexts, allow evaluation dependencies
  contexts:
    # Each context consists of a sequence of testcases to evaluate
    # A context
    - testcases:
      # Our test cases consist of a statement and a return value, this statement contains a function call
      # a function call is notated as: function_name(<argument list>), <argument list> = (<argument> [, <argument>]*)?
